# TypeScript Linked List

Linked lists, but in TypeScript!

## Included Linked List Implementations

### Queue

A queue is a First In First Out (FIFO) data structure, where the item that is queued first is processed first.
Think of a queue like a line at the grocery store. You have to wait behind everyone who got in line before you.

### Stack

A stack is a Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure, where the item inserted last is processed first.
Think of a stack like a stack of books. In order to get the bottom book, you have to take each top book off one at a time.

### Ordered List

An ordered list orders the values by either numerical or alphabetical order.
